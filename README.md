# Data Cowboy - Wrangle That Data!

# IMPORTANT TO NOTE!:
The data output for this project is just a sample of what my code can be used for. It can take an input from **any** array of enumerated objects that contain top-level key-value pairs, and **automatically** generates a fully filterable user interface.

# Concepts used:
* Reducers
* Filters
* Async/await
* Map and Set
* Integrating third-party libraries and web services such as Material.io and Google Charts

# Usage
* Select any category, set a value range, or search by the device ID to narrow your search
* Select any category above the pie chart to view specific details about the data that has been filtered
